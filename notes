What is a successful system?
<p>Definition of a system: A combination of software and hardware that provides a solution for a business problem</p>
<p>Involves:</p> 
<ul><li>The client (the request and $)</li>
<li>Analysts</li>
<li>Designers & developers</li>
<li>Testers</li>
<li>Users</li>
<li>Others (e.g. lawyers, communications officers, specialists etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>A success system may be measured by answering the following questions:</p>
<ul><li>Does the project solve what it was meant to solve?</li>
<li>Is it easy to maintain and administer?</li>
<li>Is it scalable to meet the needs of the client?</li>
<li>Is there a successful support system in place for the client?</li>
<li>Was it delivered on time and ready to go?</li>
<li>Was the client happy with the finished product?</li></ul>

The Software Development Process and Waterfall Model
<p>Creating high-quality software involves organization, planning and utilizing various diagrammatic conventions</p>
<p>Computer scientists have created a view of the software development process known as the ‘software development life cycle’ (SDLC)</p> 
<p>One method is known as the <b>‘Waterfall Model’</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Developed by Dr Winston Royce in 1970 based on his experience developing software for spacecraft mission planning</li>
<li>The Waterfall Model consists of several phases: </li>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
<li>Problem Statement
<li>Analysis</li>
<li>Design </li>
<li>Implementation </li>
<li>Integration /Test</li>
<li>Maintenance </li>
</ul>

The Software Development Process
<p>Mistakes found early in the SDLC are much less expensive to correct than those found later</p>
<p>The cost of developing software is not spread equally over the phases</p>
<ul>
<li>Integration: 8%</li>
<li>Implementation: 8%</li>
<li>Design: 8%</li>
<li>Analysis: 8%</li>
<li>Maintenance: 68%</li>
</ul>

Project Management Tool
<ul>
<li>Gantt Chart</li>
<p>Developed by mechanical engineer Henry Gantt in the 1910’s
</p>
<p>Tool typically used by people working on a large project</p>
<p>Helps project managers to visualize, schedule, and track scheduled as well as actual progress of projects
</p>
<li>UML</li>
<p>Unified Modeling Language</p>
<p>Visually specifies parts of a system</p>
<p>Complex software designs are much more easily described through UML than textually</p>
<p>UML can be complicated to learn, you are not required to use it for your projects</p>
